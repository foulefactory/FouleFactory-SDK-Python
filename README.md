Foulefactoryapilib
=================
This API SDK was automatically generated by APIMATIC v2.0

This SDK uses the Requests library and will work for Python 2.7 â€” 3.5.

How to configure:
=================
The generated code might need to be configured with your API credentials. 
To do that, open the file "Configuration.py" and edit its contents.

How to resolve dependencies: 
===========================
The generated code uses Python packages named requests, jsonpickle and dateutil.
You can resolve these dependencies using pip ( https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/ ).

  1. From terminal/cmd navigate to the root directory of the SDK.
  2. Invoke 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

Note: You will need internet access for this step.

How to use:
===========
After having resolved the dependencies, you can easily use the SDK following these steps.

  1. Create a "foulefactoryapilib_test.py" file in the root directory.
  2. Use any controller as follows:
```python
from __future__ import print_function
from foulefactoryapilib.foule_factory_api_client import *

api_client = FouleFactoryApiClient()
controller = api_client.task_answer_texts_controller
response = controller.get_task_answer_texts_get(<required parameters if any>)

print(response)
```
